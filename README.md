# Random password generator solution

Hi, this is my solution to the Random Password Generator Project on Scrimba.

https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript/

### The challenges

I should:

- Build it from "scratch"
- Generate two random passwords when the user clicks the button
- Each password should be 15 characters long

And there are stretch goals who wants to go beyond.

I should:

- Ability to set password length
- Add "copy-on-click"
- Toggle "symbols" and "numbers" on/off

### What I learned

Working on this project, I was able to improve my CSS and JS skills. I learned...

- how to use Math.random function
- how to use 'querySelector' instead of 'getElementByID'
- how to use for-loop in Javascript
- how to analyze a figma-generated design file and apply every component to CSS style

### Continued development

If I have spare time, I would like to do following works.

- (DONE) I'd like to add an input field in which the user can set password length
- I'd like to add a 'copy-on-click' button so that the user can copy passowrd to the clipboard
